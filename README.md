## Yet Another Centralized Scheduler
The	project	is	focused	on	YACS,	a centralized	scheduling	framework.	The	framework	 consists	of	one	Master,	which runs	on	a	dedicated	machine	and manages	the	resources	of the	rest	of	the	machines in	the	cluster.	The	other machines in	the	cluster	have one	Worker process running	on	each	of	them	. The	Master process makes	scheduling	decisions	while	the	Worker processes	execute	the	tasks	and	inform	the	Master	when	a	task	completes	its	execution.
